# Polyhedron Operators

This crate implements the [Conway Polyhedral
Operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation)
and their extensions by [George W. Hart](http://www.georgehart.com/)
and others.

This is an experiment to imporve my understanding of iterators
in Rust. It is based on Hartâ€™s OpenSCAD code which, being
functional, leads itself well to being translated to functional Rust.

## Supported Operators

- [x] kN - kis on N-sided faces (if no N, then general kis)
- [ ] a - ambo
- [ ] g - gyro
- [x] d - dual
- [ ] r - reflect
- [ ] e - explode (a.k.a. expand, equiv. to aa)
- [ ] b - bevel (equiv. to ta)
- [ ] o - ortho (equiv. to jj)
- [ ] m - meta (equiv. to k3j)
- [ ] tN - truncate vertices of degree N (equiv. to dkNd; if no N, then truncate all vertices)
- [ ] j - join (equiv. to dad)
- [ ] s - snub (equiv. to dgd)
- [ ] p - propellor
- [ ] c - chamfer
- [ ] w - whirl
- [ ] q - quinto
